## Debugging in JavaScript
Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs. It involves:

** Identifying errors (syntax, runtime, or logical errors).
** Using debugging tools to analyze code execution.
** Implementing fixes and verifying correctness.

## Types of Errors in JavaScript
1) Syntax Errors: 
Issues with incorrect syntax, preventing execution.
e.g
console.log("Hello);
// SyntaxError: missing closing quote

2) Runtime Errors:
Errors occurring during execution.

e.g.
let a = undefined;
console.log(a.length);
// TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined

3) Logical Errors: 
Code runs without errors but produces incorrect results.

e.g
function add(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}
 // Logical error: should use + instead of -


## JavaScript Debuggers
1. Built-in Debugging Tools
Modern browsers provide built-in JavaScript debuggers, accessible via Developer Tools. 
Debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported. 
They allow setting breakpoints and examining variables while code executes.

** Steps to Activate Debugging:

Chrome: Open "More tools" → "Developer tools" → Select "Console".
Firefox: Open "Web Developer" → "Web Console".
Edge: Open "Developer Tools" → Select "Console".
Opera: Open "Developer" → "Developer tools" → "Console".
Safari: Enable "Show Develop menu in menu bar" under Preferences, then select "Show Error Console".

2. Using console.log()
One of the simplest debugging techniques is logging messages to the console.

let x = 10;
console.log("Value of x:", x);

3. Setting Breakpoints
Breakpoints stop execution at specific lines, allowing variable inspection.

Open DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I).
Navigate to the "Sources" tab.
Click on line numbers to set breakpoints.
Resume execution using the play button after analysis.

4. Using the debugger Keyword
The debugger statement stops execution and opens debugging tools.
If debugging is unavailable, debugger has no effect.

function test() {
    let n = 42;
    debugger; // Execution pauses here
    console.log(n);
}
test();
