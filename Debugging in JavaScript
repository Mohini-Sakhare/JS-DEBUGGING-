## Debugging in JavaScript
Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs. It involves:

** Identifying errors (syntax, runtime, or logical errors).
** Using debugging tools to analyze code execution.
** Implementing fixes and verifying correctness.

## Types of Errors in JavaScript
1) Syntax Errors: 
Issues with incorrect syntax, preventing execution.
e.g
console.log("Hello);
// SyntaxError: missing closing quote

2) Runtime Errors:
Errors occurring during execution.

e.g.
let a = undefined;
console.log(a.length);
// TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined

3) Logical Errors: 
Code runs without errors but produces incorrect results.

e.g
function add(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}
 // Logical error: should use + instead of -


## JavaScript Debuggers
1. Built-in Debugging Tools
Modern browsers provide built-in JavaScript debuggers, accessible via Developer Tools. 
Debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported. 
They allow setting breakpoints and examining variables while code executes.

** Steps to Activate Debugging:

Chrome: Open "More tools" → "Developer tools" → Select "Console".
Firefox: Open "Web Developer" → "Web Console".
Edge: Open "Developer Tools" → Select "Console".
Opera: Open "Developer" → "Developer tools" → "Console".
Safari: Enable "Show Develop menu in menu bar" under Preferences, then select "Show Error Console".
