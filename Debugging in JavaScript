## Debugging in JavaScript
Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs. It involves:

** Identifying errors (syntax, runtime, or logical errors).
** Using debugging tools to analyze code execution.
** Implementing fixes and verifying correctness.

## Types of Errors in JavaScript
1) Syntax Errors: 
Issues with incorrect syntax, preventing execution.
e.g
console.log("Hello);
// SyntaxError: missing closing quote

2) Runtime Errors:
Errors occurring during execution.

e.g.
let a = undefined;
console.log(a.length);
// TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
